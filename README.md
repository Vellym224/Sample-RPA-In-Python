# RPA-in-Python
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a system that allows businesses to automate processes and tasks that are typically carried out by employees. This system can work across different applications, platforms, and departments. RPA integrates well with the existing IT infrastructure and doesn’t require any additional installations. Companies don’t have to invest heavily to automate essential processes. 

Here is a sample PROJECT that one can invoke and modify as you wish. Simple code indeed. What this RPA does is that it collects data from that website and create a spreadsheet in the same folder where the automation file is saved. open the folder wheree you stored the automation file where u will find an spreadsheet file to open and view collected data. Enjoy!
